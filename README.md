## Projects

### 2018-21: Development of a telemedical assistance system called Marine Doctor for seafarers 
The purpose of “MARINE DOCTOR” is to simplify the medical assistance of seafarers. The developed software is friendly simple, fast, and compatible with any computer. The main function of the system is to register and store seafarers' and doctors' details and guide the user to send a medical request with a simple form of a questionnaire. 

	2021-2023: Marche Biobanks
The collaborative research platform for personalized medicine: drugs, diagnostics, and new therapeutic approaches. Marche Biobank’s reach is strategic for 4P (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Participatory) medicine.

	2020-2022: Enabling Consumers to Become Prosumer in the Energy Transition Era (ECPE) 
The purpose of the project is to coordinate the various norms, collecting and promoting best practices in the interpretation and application of the various forms. The project will analyse the prosumer's behaviours from multiple perspectives (for this reason is very important the choose a multidisciplinary approach from all partners). The ECPE project will enhance the use of collaborative behaviour in the energy consumption and production market.

	2022-2024: Development of seafarer’s health observatory (OSPIEMARE)  

This project aims to develop a data observatory of seafarers to improve health status by monitoring communicable and non-communicable diseases of seafarers by monitoring their health and disease trends, creating a standard tool (questionnaires), and conducting a risk assessment.

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
